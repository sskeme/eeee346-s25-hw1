# Introduction

In this homework assignment, you will be implementing simple statistical functions. See how `cout` and `cin` are used, how a header file is used, and how functions are called. 

# Tasks

1. Receive three numbers using `cin` in main(). You may assume that only integers are entered. 

2. Compute the median by implementing median() in stats.cpp. Call the function in main() and print out the result using `cout`. Refer to stats.h for its return data type and parameters.

4. Repeat for max().

5. Repeat for min().

# Compile and Run

1. Type the following commands on Terminal.
```
g++ -o main *.cpp *.h
```
```
./main
```

2. Enter three integers and check if your result is correct. The following is an example:
```
3 4 6
Average: 4.33
Median: 4
Min: 3
Max: 6
```

# Submission

Please upload your `main.cpp` and `stats.cpp` files to `myCourses > Assignments > HW1`. Do not submit *.docx, *.pdf, *.txt, or *.zip file.
